Minecraft Craftbukkit Service ( MCCBS )
=======================================
mccbs is a systemd .service for all \*nix systems now using systemd instead of the good old fashioned init.d scripts. The systemd script starts and stops a Craftbukkit Minecraft Server with features on the side. This is a port from an init script forked from Ahtenus/minecraft-init with a few tweaks here and their. 

This is also A project to help ME understand systemd, As well as get things kickstarted in git as well as bash scripting including anything in between and along the way. I know its a big cookie but you have to start somewhere. 

Features

Setup
=====

<!-- 1. Symlink the minecraft file to `/etc/init.d/minecraft`, set the required premissions and update rc.d.

		sudo ln -s ~/minecraft-init/minecraft /etc/init.d/minecraft
		chmod 755  ~/minecraft-init/minecraft
		sudo update-rc.d minecraft defaults

2. Edit the variables in `config.example` to your needs and rename it to `config` (leaving it in the same folder as the original minecraft script)

3. Move your worlds to the folder specified by `WORLDSTORAGE`

4. Edit crontab

	As the server user:
	
		crontab -e

	Add these lines:

		#m 	h 	dom	mon	dow	command
		02 	05 	*	*	*	/etc/init.d/minecraft backup
		55 	04 	*	*	*	/etc/init.d/minecraft log-roll
		*/30 	* 	*	*	*	/etc/init.d/minecraft to-disk


5. To load a world from ramdisk run:

		/etc/init.d/minecraft ramdisk WORLDNAME
	
	to disable ramdisk, run the same command again.


For more help with the script, run

	/etc/init.d/minecraft help
